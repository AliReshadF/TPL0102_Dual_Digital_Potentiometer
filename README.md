# TPL0102_Dual_Digital_Potentiometer
Arduino library for the Texas Instruments TPL0102 Two 256-Taps Digital Potentiometers With Non-Volatile Memory


Hiya!

I am thrilled to share with you my version of the library for controlling the [TPL0102](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slis134c/slis134c.pdf) from Texas Instruments. The library was tested with a 100kOhms device.

It is a compact 14-pin dual 256 taps I2C potentiometer with non-volatible registers. Pretty handy for digitally controlled amplifiers, PID controllers and in words of the manufacturer: suitable for Adjustable Power Supplies, Precision Calibration of Set Point Thresholds, Sensor Trimming and Calibration, Mechanical, Potentiometer Replacement etc.

Please read and play around with the example codes to get a good grasp of the usability of the library.

I am aware that there is still a lot to be polished in the code but I will do my best within the following days.

**UPDATE**
14-May-2020

Just updated this to the latest version: 0.3. 
The main intention is to use this library with the breakout/Development Boards soon to be available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/ivorycircuits/). In advance, I can say that there is a tiny mistake on these boards where I accidentally swapped the position of LED_CHA and LED_CHB. Not a big deal, as it can be solved by software. I will make sure that the next version does not have this issue.


Stay safe
