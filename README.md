# TPL0102_Dual_Digital_Potentiometer
Arduino library for the Texas Instruments TPL0102 Two 256-Taps Digital Potentiometers With Non-Volatile Memory


Hiya!

I am thrilled to share with you my version of the library for communicating and controlling the [TPL0102](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slis134c/slis134c.pdf) from Texas Instruments. The library was tested with a 100kOhms device.

It is a compact 14-pin dual 256 taps I2C potentiometer with non-volatible registers. Pretty handy for digitally controlled amplifiers, PID controllers, etc.

Please read and play around with the example codes to get a good grasp of the usability of the library.

I am aware that there is still a lot to be polished in the code but I will do my best within the following days.

Stay safe

Cheers :beer:
